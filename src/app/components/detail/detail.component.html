                    <p class="lh-lg my-3">There is no denying the fact that effective communication is the key to ensure
                        the impactful
                        impression you as an individual can have on others and hence, this is one such skill that
                        everyone should possess. There are several misconceptions about the concept of communication and
                        we should clearly understand them in order to enhance our skills.</p>
                    <h1>Getting involved in a conversation</h1>
                    <p class="lh-lg">Usually, it is perceived that having the right communication is denoted by the
                        ability to speak
                        incessantly in order to display the confidence, this is the biggest blunder one can make. We
                        need to understand that an effective communication is about getting involved in the conversation
                        and responding to participate in the discussion and not just blabber.</p>
                    <p>Here are 8 quick points that we should follow in every conversation we have.</p>
                    <ol class="list-group-numbered">
                        <li class="list-group-item lh-lg bg-transparent text-dark-mode2">It is imperative to listen to others when they speak and allow
                            them time to finish what they have to suggest. Frequent interjections is not only
                            unprofessional and rude but it also denotes the inability to comprehend.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item lh-lg bg-transparent text-dark-mode2">We should listen to understand and not simply hear for the
                            mere sake of formality, please keep in mind that every communication we establish and every
                            conversation we have teaches us something.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item lh-lg bg-transparent text-dark-mode2">It is of paramount importance to be humble and respectful
                            towards others. Our body language, eye contact, and subtle facial expressions, everything
                            plays a vital role here.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item lh-lg bg-transparent text-dark-mode2">To be able to respond, it is important for us to understand
                            the crux of the discussion and then present our views in a very gentle yet impactful manner.
                            Remember, the choice of words and the tone we use are the weapons we have here, we should
                            not use it roughly as the impact can be damaging for ourselves.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item lh-lg bg-transparent text-dark-mode2">The dogmatic behavior would never work, if you are an eloquent
                            and passionate speaker, others may apparently seem to be agreeing but this is an inaccurate
                            way, we should be open to ideas and open to learning and even if we do not agree, the way we
                            respond back should be reverential.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item lh-lg bg-transparent text-dark-mode2">The language we speak does not really matter as long as we are
                            fully participating in the conversation and have the ability to comprehend what is being
                            said and then respond. Language is just a tool to have an ideal conversation, it is never a
                            conversation in itself.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item lh-lg bg-transparent text-dark-mode2">It is absolutely fine not knowing something and even if we do
                            not, we can still participate in a conversation by listening, taking a deep cognizance of
                            the subject, responding through our body language, and acknowledging the others with a mild
                            smile of agreement.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item lh-lg bg-transparent text-dark-mode2">Even the finest public speakers in the world have similar
                            opinion about the ability to have a good communication, they all somewhere suggest that we
                            should be enthusiastic to converse, inquisitive to learn, ready to listen, able to
                            understand and then eloquent enough to respond. Having good communication skills is all
                            about the amalgamation of the essentials.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="lh-lg border-bottom">The aforementioned points can be followed and practiced, it may take
                        some time but we should understand that miracles donâ€™t happen in a day. All we need to ensure is
                        that we continue learning and practicing and very soon, the difference will be noticeable and
                        every communication we have will be impactful.</p>
